# car-inventory-dashboard
Excel data modelling project with Fact/Dim schema and interactive dashboard.
**📊 Car Inventory Dashboard (Excel + Tableau)**
␣␣
*📌 Overview*
This project analyzes a fictional car inventory dataset using a Fact/Dimension star schema, Excel-based data modelling, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.
The goal is to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, modelling, KPI creation, and visual analytics.
The final dashboard allows users to explore:
Mileage patterns
Warranty risk
Driver behaviour
Car age distribution
Make/Model performance
␣␣
*🧱 Data Model (Star Schema)*
The dataset was modelled using a Fact table and multiple Dimension tables:
Code
                 DimDriver
                     |
                 DriverKey
                     |
DimCar — CarKey — FactCarInventory — MakeModelKey — DimMakeModel
                     |
                 WarrantyKey
                     |
                 DimWarranty

***📈 Dashboard Features (Tableau)***
The interactive Tableau dashboard includes:
1. Miles by Driver
Horizontal bar chart ranking drivers by total mileage.
2. Warranty Risk
Pie chart showing the proportion of cars exceeding warranty limits.
3. Car Age Distribution
Column chart showing how many cars fall into each age group.
4. Average Miles by Make
Bar chart comparing average mileage across manufacturers.
5. Interactive Filters
Users can filter the entire dashboard by:
Driver
Make
Model
Warranty Status
Age
